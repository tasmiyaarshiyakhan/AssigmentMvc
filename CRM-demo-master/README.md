## Detailed description & Features
The application is a simple CRUD application allowing to Create, Read, Update, Delete records fro database. It is a Web application where
you manage a list of clients (CRM - Customer Relationship Management). The database used is MySQL and Hibernate ORM is used to communicate with it.

### Architecture

The browser sends the request to the Controller (Spring MVC). The controller find the method based on mapping specified (eg. @ReguestMapping).
In this specific application, the method will communicate with Service Fascade Object which will delegate the request to DAO object. DAO is 
responsible for communication with database. If there is any result to return. DAO will pass to Controller through service layer. The Controller
will return appropriate view and model to the browser.
